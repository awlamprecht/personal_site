One of my personal goals as a scientist is to make information easily accessable to the public. I love to share my passion for the natural world with others! I currently volunteer with Discovery Squad at the Field Museum of Natural History. This is a great program aimed at engaging museum visitors in a hands-on way that allows them to be exposed to our natural history collections that they wouldn't get in the exhibits. I enjoy telling guests about the exciting things happening behind closed doors at the museum that make it an exciting environment for research and conservation!
